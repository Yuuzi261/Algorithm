## Problem: Dictionary

The goal of this project is to construct corresponding Dictionaries using Binary Search Tree (BST), Splay Tree (SPT), and Treap. The Dictionary will be used for searching operations and time analysis, including query times, success rates, and failure rates. Additionally, the relationship between Dictionary size, searching file size, execution time, and efficiency will be discussed.

### Functions:

1. **Build BST, SPT, and Treap with a Text File Input (test.txt):**
   - Define tokens and words in the dictionary.

2. **Searching with an Input Test File:**
   - Perform searches based on an input file (part of the `test.txt` file).

3. **Search a Word:**
   - Search for a word (input either from a file or keyboard).

4. **Add a Word:**
   - Add a word to the dictionary (input either from a file or keyboard).

5. **Delete a Word:**
   - Delete a word from the dictionary (input either from a file or keyboard).
