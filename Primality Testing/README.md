## Primality Testing

### Problem:
Determine whether a given positive integer \( n \) is prime! Implement and analyze the following algorithms:

**i. Basic Prime Testing**
**ii. Sieve of Eratosthenes**
**iii. Fermat Primality Testing (Randomized Algorithm)**
**iv. Miller-Rabin Primality Testing (Randomized Algorithm)**

### Tasks:
- Implement and analyze the above algorithms.
- Compare and analyze the execution time of algorithms (i) to (iv) for \( n = 100 \) to \( 1,000,000 \) or more.
- Analyze the probability of correctly identifying a prime number for the randomized algorithms (iii) and (iv).
- Handle large input values effectively.
